It should be noted that, this is a basic shell of a verb conjugator, you need to implement the rules of 
suffixation and phonetic changes as well as the logic for different tenses and conjugations. 
It is a non-trivial task and requires a good understanding of Turkish grammar, and it is recommended to consult a professional.
